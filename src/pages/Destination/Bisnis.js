                        Alor possesses a unique and authentic cultural heritage from its ancestors, which may not be
                        found elsewhere in the world.
                        This cultural heritage, expressed through customs and traditions, has made Alor known to
                        tourists as an island with a traditional village and primitive way of life.
                        These activities can still be found today in a cultural village called Takpala Village.
                        Takpala Village began to gain attention in 1973 when a tourist from the Netherlands displayed
                        photos of the traditional life of the village residents in a calendar, attracting the interest
                        of other European tourists to visit the place.
                        Since then, Takpala Village has become famous and is bustling with visits from foreign tourists.
                        Even domestically, since 1980, the village has achieved second place in the competition for the
                        Most Traditional Village in Indonesia. Furthermore, in 1983, the Alor Regency Government
                        declared Takpala Village as the tourism icon of Alor.

                            Liman Beach is the longest beach on this island, featuring a stretch of fine white sand.
                            The beauty of the beach is clearly visible from the height of Liman Hill. This hill has
                            slopes of up to 30 degrees and reaches a height of about 160 meters.
                            Climbing Liman Hill requires stamina, or skill in riding a two-wheeled vehicle, as the sandy
                            and steep trails have no barriers. However, the view from the top of Liman Hill is indeed
                            breathtaking and worth the effort, especially at sunset. Right in the middle of the horizon,
                            the mysterious Taboi Island can be seen, with only a dark flat surface visible.
                            Enjoying the beauty of Otan and Liman beaches will be even more comfortable as
                            accommodations and restaurants have been available since 2020.
