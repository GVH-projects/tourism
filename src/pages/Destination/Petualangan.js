                            Mount Kelimutu, located on Flores Island, NTT Province, Indonesia, is home to three crater
                            lakes named the Tri-Colored Lakes: red, blue, and white. These colors change over time.
                            "Kelimutu" derives from "keli" (mountain) and "mutu" (boiling), according to local beliefs,
                            the colors of the lakes hold meanings and natural powers.
                            Tiwu Kelimutu is divided into three sections: blue (youthful souls), red (souls who
                            committed crimes), and white (old souls). When the lakes change color, the inhabitants offer
                            offerings to the deceased spirits.
                            These three lakes cover an area of approximately 1,051,000 square meters with a water volume
                            of 1.292 million cubic meters. They are bordered by narrow and steep stone walls with
                            heights ranging from 50 to 150 meters and slopes of 70 degrees.

                    <p className="lead" style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
                        Recently, Kupang Regency has been gaining viral attention on social media, particularly due to
                        the beauty of its hills reminiscent of the Teletubbies. This has sparked curiosity among people
                        who are now interested in experiencing the natural beauty of these hills firsthand.
                        The Teletubbies Hill, known as Lelogama Hill, is located in the South Amfoang area of Kupang
                        Regency, approximately 110 km from Kupang City, which can be reached in about 2.5 hours.
                        The journey to Lelogama is relatively smooth, as the road is paved, but it is winding, hilly,
                        and at several points, quite steep with numerous sharp turns forming S-shapes multiple times.
                        Therefore, both motorbike and car riders need to be cautious and ensure their vehicles are in
                        good condition before driving.
                        To reach this location, one must head towards Takari and before reaching the Takari gas station,
                        turn left if coming from Kupang City. Throughout the journey, travelers will be treated to
                        beautiful mountainous scenery.
                        Upon entering the area of the Teletubbies Hill location, visitors will be greeted by the vast
                        Ampupu Forest area, approximately 4 kilometers before reaching the main destination. The scenery
                        is reminiscent of the landscapes in Fatumnasi, South Central Timor Regency.

                            destination. Although access is difficult due to rough and steep roads, the journey to this
                            hill takes about 40 minutes from Kalabahi. The view from the top, including panoramas of
                            islands such as Buaya, Ternante, Pura, Pantar, Tereweng, and Kepa, is truly captivating.
                            However, the main highlight is the sunset beside Ternante Island, creating a breathtaking
