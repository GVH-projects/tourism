                        Oebali Beach is situated in a cove bordered by hills that are not too high. Most of it is filled
                        with rocks, predominantly white in color, indicating they likely originated from the sea. So,
                        one can imagine that if collecting gemstones were still popular, this beach might be one of
                        those swarmed by gemstone seekers, selling them under various names.
                        The sand of the beach isn't as white as the sand on Semau Island, for example; its color tends
                        toward a bright brown, reminiscent of the sand at Lasiana Beach. The sand is flat, meaning the
                        influence of the tides is very noticeable. When you visit during low tide, the beach stretches
                        out long and far. Even during high tide, the seawater remains clear, making it enjoyable for
                        swimming, especially when the waves aren't too big, like when I visited.
